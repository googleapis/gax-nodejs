# Test application for google-gax

This test application is based on GAPIC Showcase API Client (automatically
generated by [gapic-generator](https://github.com/googleapis/gapic-generator).

[GAPIC Showcase](https://github.com/googleapis/gapic-showcase) Echo service is
the sample GAPIC service that shows all the features of generated API clients:

- retries
- timeouts
- long running operations
- client streaming
- server streaming
- bi-directional streaming
- automatic pagination

Since all these features are supported by GAX, the Showcase library is a great
use case for these features.

## showcase-echo-client

This folder contains a client library for the `Echo` service of
[gapic-showcase](https://github.com/googleapis/gapic-showcase),
as generated by
[gapic-generator-typescript](https://github.com/googleapis/gapic-generator-typescript).

It uses `google-gax`, so by having this generated code here, we can verify that the
changes made to this library don't break the code of the generated libraries.

The only modification is in `package.json`, where it's set to depend on the local
version of `google-gax` being tested.
